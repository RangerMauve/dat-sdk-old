# dat-sdk-old
This is a convenience module to get `dat-sdk` before the migration to the `hyper://` protocol.

This can be used in tandem with the main `dat-sdk` version so you can have two versions of the SDK loaded at once.


The docs are the same as dat-sdk@1.

```shell
npm i --save dat-sdk-old
```

```js
const sdk = require('dat-sdk-old/auto')
```
